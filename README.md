### Routes

`cljsexample.clj`

### Source code for the examples:

`src-cljs/main.cljs` as well as the templates `coreasync-1.html` and `coreasync-2.html`

Example 2 has a pure javascript for comparison purposes at `js-core-async.js` 

## Acknowledgements

Example 1 is a port of Rob Pike's talk [Go Concurrency Patterns](talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide) and Example 2 was taken from David Nolen's post [Communicating Sequential Processes](http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/12/communicating-sequential-processes/).
